# CSC 600 - Programming Language Design

1. Survey, Classification, History, and Concepts of Programming Languages. Imperative, objectoriented,
logic, and functional languages: concepts and applications. Procedural and nonprocedural programming. Syntax and semantics of programming languages. Evaluation and comparison of programming languages. Systematic presentation of programming language concepts. Selecting languages for specific applications.

2. Presentation/survey and comparison of specific languages: Prolog, Scheme, Ruby, Fortran, Cobol, Basic, Pascal and other languages. Program development in selected languages: procedural programming (C, C++), logic programming (Prolog), functional programming (Scheme/Racket/Lisp), and OO programming (Ruby). Translation of programs from a source language to a given target language and reuse of legacy programs and program libraries (optional segment). Software performance issues.

3. Design of languages and language processors. Macro processors and language expansion techniques. Design and implementation of interpreters and virtual machines. (Optional segment)
